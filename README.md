## Welcome to the First Half

Here we will be covering the preliminaries and getting everyone comfortable with Python. Hence, we’ll start by equipping ourselves with essential ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are crucial for data manipulation and visualization. Following this, we’ll delve into ONE of the foundational concepts of machine learning, which will be one of Linear Regression or Logistic Regression (essentially binary Classification).

Then we would perform some introduction to OpenCV, which would be useful for the final Project.

## Second Half
Implementing the Project!
