# WIDS_2024_Facial_recognition
I am Yug Agarwal, thirdie in Electrical Engineering. I am your mentor and will be managing this repo for WIDS 4.0 (2024). 

## Welcome to the First Half

Here we will be covering the preliminaries and getting everyone comfortable with Python. Hence, we’ll start by equipping ourselves with essential ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are crucial for data manipulation and visualization. This would take only **3-4 days**. You will need to solve an assignment/excercise related to this part.

Following this, we’ll delve into ONE of the foundational concepts of machine learning, which will be one of Linear Regression or Logistic Regression (essentially binary Classification). This would take about **a week**. You will need to solve an assignment/excercise related to this part.

Then we would perform some introduction to OpenCV, which would be useful for the final Project. This would take about 3-4 days. There **may** be an assignment for this part, depending on the difficulty of the content - if too difficult then assignment will be coming through.

I am planning to cover this whole half in about 2 weeks.

## Welcome to the Second Half
Implementing the Project! This should take about 8-10 days, 2 weeks at max. Obviously, I would require to see your **working** ipynb file for the final certificate.

The **ONLY** requirement to pass this WIDS is to **complete the Second Half**, those peeps who want to skip the basics can directly jump to second half. People who feel like going through the basics should go over both the first and second halves.

Stay engaged and practice consistently to make the most of this learning experience. Keep your enthusiasm high, and let’s begin this exciting journey into machine learning together!
