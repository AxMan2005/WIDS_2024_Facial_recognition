# WIDS_2024_Facial_recognition_Basics
## Welcome to the First Half

Here we will be covering the preliminaries and getting everyone comfortable with Python. Hence, we’ll start by equipping ourselves with essential ML libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which are crucial for data manipulation and visualization. Following this, we’ll delve into ONE of the foundational concepts of machine learning, which will be one of Linear Regression or Logistic Regression (essentially binary Classification). This would take about a week

Then we would perform some introduction to OpenCV, which would be useful for the final Project. This would take about 3-4 days

I am planning to cover this whole half in about 10 days
## Second Half
Implementing the Project! This should take about 8-10 days, 2 weeks at max.

Stay engaged and practice consistently to make the most of this learning experience. Keep your enthusiasm high, and let’s begin this exciting journey into machine learning together!
